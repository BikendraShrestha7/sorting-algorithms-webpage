# sorting-algorithms-webpage


This project involved creating a basic HTML5 webpage to present four fundamental sorting algorithms: Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort. The webpage was structured using semantic HTML elements such as <head>, <meta>, <title>, <body>, <header>, <div>, <pre>, <code>, <p>, <main>, and <footer>. Each sorting algorithm section includes a brief explanation followed by a JavaScript implementation wrapped within a <pre><code> block. Additionally, ID and class attributes were used for better organization and styling. The project was uploaded to GitHub, and the webpage was deployed using GitHub Pages. Below are the links to the GitHub repository and the deployed webpage:
